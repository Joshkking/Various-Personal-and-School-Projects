# Old Javascript Readme

Many eons ago I decided, over Christmas break, to learn Javascript and make a wiki for research article summaries. It was an idealistic but utterly naieve idea which was duley abandoned. However, I have some really cool auto-formatting on the website and could even pull in citation information from API access places on the internet simply given some info on the article (typically the DOI number). I've lost most of that code, but I did find this old script set I emailed to myself which worked on printing out citations automatically. It's probably *terrible*, it's missing the rest of the pieces of it, and now I'd probably have to stare at it for some time to tell you what it does, BUT including here for the odd proudness that at the time I had little/no CompSci background and proof that I did indeed learn some Javascript just over Christmas. 0:)
