# Various-School-Projects

This repository is for various projects scattered about from my Nanodegree program and Masters in Data Analytics. Here I only chose to pull examples that have some self-defined context as much of the work done was scattered across interconnected jupyter notebook prompts. A couple of other things done during the school era worth checking out are in there own repositories:  My rather lengthy "guide" with examples on [statistics in Python](https://github.com/Joshkking/Python-Statistics) and an also fairly lengthy set of [SQL examples and problems](https://github.com/Joshkking/SQL-Examples) I made.

Regarding the actual items in this repository, a very brief explanation of each follows with the bold ones probably more worth checking out:
* Basic Tableau Work - One simple project on choosing the right car (creating a dashboard for this) and another example workbook showing unintuitive Tableau exercises.
* **Loans Data Exploration, Analysis, and Visualization** - A modest sized project investigating loan data with a focus on creating different visualizations
* Simple Movie Database Investigation - An early-on simple data analysis project from start to finish
* Simple R Work - A very, very simple and short linear regression script (nothing fancy here)
* **Web Scrape Work** - A couple of projects - one simply that of a unique link scraper, the other a much more funn **Twitter API scrape and analysis of the WeRateDogs account**
* **AB Test Example** - Less a "project" than a sort of fill-in-the-blank guide on doing an A/B test on a website visit using bootstrap and statistical testing as well as logistic regression. Guided, but a handy example.
