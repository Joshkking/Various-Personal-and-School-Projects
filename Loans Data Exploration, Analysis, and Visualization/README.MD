# Prosper Loands Data Exploration, Analysis, and Visualization Readme

For this project we were challenged to pick a dataset, investigate whatever leads we chose, and communicate our results using **many different visualization** types via Matplotlib and Seaborn visualizations. I chose the Prosper Loan Datset and generally ended up looking at who Prosper made better loas off of (though again, the main point of this project was getting practice in visualizations).

There are a number of files here, so I'll bold the key ones:
* **exploration_analysis_loans.html (& .ipynb)** - This is the jupyter notebook where I actually did the original investigation. I provide the html version in case the notebook doesn't pull up.
* **slide_deck_loans files** - These are all essentially the same file in different formats- that file being a sort of "Powerpoint" presentation using Jupyter Notebooks slide tools.
  * The **slide_deck_loans.slides.html** file is the actual presentation itself (may not load, but give it a minute or two to try as the result is cool). Don't forget you can navigate "down" on each slide to actually see the visualizations.
  * The slide_deck loans.html & .ipynb files are the original notebook the slide presentation was created in. If you can't get the slide_deck_loans to load, you can see the less pretty version there.
* report.md - We were asked to do a quick explanation of our results in a markdown file.
* output_toggle.tpl - Jupyter Notebooks uses this to create the slide presentation version I used where the code for the visualizations is hidden unless clicked to view.
* "Prosper Loan Data - Variable Definitions.xlsx" - Exactly what is sounds like. I couldn't include the actual data here (too large), but the variable definitions here (which were provided to me) can help in interpretation of the work.
