# Basic Tableau SQL Work Readme

Most of my current (to date of readme edit) has been self-taught via recreating visualizations in Tableau as I worked along other projects in Python, so there are few projects here directly to show. Still I wanted to include a few relevant files for reference and my own safe-keeping:
* "Right Car for Right Price" Files - A small project for part of my Masters. We were supposed to create a dashboard off of some web-scraped car info to help the company make that decision. The included files for this are:
  * The packaged workbook file.
  * A pdf print-out of the dashboard for ease of view. Note that by converting to pdf, it loses the interactive features and some formatting.
* The "Unintuitive Tableau Examples..." file. This is a packaged workbook off of the well-known "SuperStore" data (included in the package) showing a couple of example worksheets demonstrating some of the less intuitive functionalities in Tableau such as LOD calculations, Context Filters, etc.
