# Twitter Disaster Prediction

This is some predictive work on the fairly commonly studied twitter disaster prediction dataset. It was my first work trying to tackle a NLP problem more directly and as such had a number of mistakes. A post-mortem is included though at the top of the notebook to hopefully discuss those mistakes. Here is a handy notebook viewer link if GIT isn't displaying well-- [click here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Joshkking/Various-Personal-and-School-Projects/blob/master/Twitter%20Disaster%20Prediction/Twitter%20Disaster%20Prediction.ipynb).
