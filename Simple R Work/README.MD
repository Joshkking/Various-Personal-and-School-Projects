# Simple R Work Readme

This was a... well, quite too easy R project to do a simple linear regression on some census data. I include it here though as it was one of the only self-contained R projects (others be little code functions to run) and it does show a nice reshaping of the data and simple tidyverse functions to use. The included files are the short report I had to write, the script itself, and the included data.
