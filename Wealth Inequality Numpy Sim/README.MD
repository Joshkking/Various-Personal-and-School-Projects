# Wealth Inequality Sim Readme

This is a basic simulation example of the "yard sale" economic model. I stumbled on a Scientific American article suggesting that *extreme* wealth inequality was an inevitable outcome of free-market exchanges, ***even when chance is the only relevant factor***. The premise of [the article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-inequality-inevitable/) was so interesting that I felt like I wanted to build a quick simulation myself to try it out. Sure enough, I got the same (unpleasant!) results.

The Jupyter Notebook file as well as a quick pdf print (in case the jupyter file doesn't render) are both included.
