# Credit Card Default Readme

This is one of the longer, more academic projects for my Masters which results in the generation of various SciKit-Learn/Machine Learning models to predict credit card default on a UCI repository dataset. The research question included is vary narrow as I am to show that only a subset of features used in the dataset are required to build an acceptable model. While this may seem obvious, a paper written on this same dataset (reference in the notebook) seems to suggest using the full feature set (or at least doesn't describe its methodologies otherwise).

In the least, it provides an example of model building (and hyperparameter tuning when necessary) of the following techniques:
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
* Neural Net/Multilayer Perceptron

The included files are the Juyper Notebook created, an html printout of the notebook for ease of viewing (download and view in any browser), the dataset used, and a csv file representing the resultant scores.
