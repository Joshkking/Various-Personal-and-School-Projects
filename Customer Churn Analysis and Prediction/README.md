# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This was a project from my Masters wherein I was asked to asked to analyze customer Churn data from a made-up telecommunications company. It was a nice opportunity to use a number of tools and techniques such as various nonparametric statistical tests, a number of visualizations, factor analysis of mixed datatypes (FAMD), and both random forests and logistic regression for churn classification.

The included files are:
* Csv file -- The initial dataset used in the project
* Ipynb file -- The code used in the project in the format of a Jupyter notebook
* Html file -- The same Jupyter notebook file as an html print-out for ease of viewing.
